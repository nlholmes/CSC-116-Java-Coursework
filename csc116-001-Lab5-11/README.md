## MyMath Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise? 

Perfectly

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise? 

We used Math class functions, such as Math.min and Math.max

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise? 

Math class functions are useful

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.

10 minutes

## MyAreaCalculations Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

* What is already known about the problem?
* What questions do you have about the problem?

We must complete the triangleArea and cylinderSurfaceArea methods 

What is the equation for the surface area of a cylinder

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

Math class and parameter use

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

An algorithm that takes the sides of a triangle and finds area
An algorithm that takes radius and height of cylinder and finds surface area

## MyAreaCalculations Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise? 

Perfectly

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise? 

Used Math.sqrt and Math.pi functions

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise? 

Learned that you can find the area of a triangle with only side lengths without doing (1/2) base*height

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.

10 minutes

## Grades Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

* What is already known about the problem?
* What questions do you have about the problem?

Create a class called Grades, that has a method called grade that takes a grade parameter and returns the grade on the 4.0 scale

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

Parameters and Math class

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

grade method 

variable that we can update with each method call to grade that will return correct value for gpa credit

### Sharing and Extending
To help you consider alternative perspectives, share and discuss your initial analysis and solution plan with another group that you will be paired with.

The other group decided our course of action was better than theirs, considering they hadn't come up with anything by that point. 

### Final Planning
After sharing ideas, what changes would you make to enhance your solution plan?
