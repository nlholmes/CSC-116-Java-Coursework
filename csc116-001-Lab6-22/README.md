## Reverse Input from User Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

* What is already known about the problem?
* What questions do you have about the problem?

Have to switch the first and last names that are given by the user. How do I index to the last name?

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

The Scanner input method and the string-related commands for indexing will help

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

Need to get the indicies of the first and last names to divide the name into first and last parts, then later call them in a different order.

### Sharing and Extending
To help you consider alternative perspectives, share and discuss your initial analysis and solution plan with another group.

Individual assignment.

### Final Planning
After sharing ideas, what changes would you make to enhance your solution plan?  

Individual assignment

## Reverse Input from User Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise? 

Fine, no problems.

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise? 

I used substring and the scanner variables

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise? 

I got a btter understanding of how the substring command works

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.

About 20

## Coconuts Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

* What is already known about the problem?
* What questions do you have about the problem?

Know the equation for the puzzle, the commands to use, and the format for the code.
No questions about this one.

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

Input commands will be useful here.

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

Need to get an input and then calculate the number of coconuts using the formula that involves a.
After that, loop through and calculate for each sailor and update the number.
Print the sailor numbers in the loop, the initial number before, and the divided number at the end.

## Coconuts Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise? 

Just fine, no problems.

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise? 

I used the input commands again.

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise? 

It was more of just practicing what I already knew, but now I am more comfortable with the input commands and can use them with loops.

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.

About 20 to 30 minutes.
