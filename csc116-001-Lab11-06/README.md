## All Digits Odd? Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

* What is already known about the problem?
* What questions do you have about the problem?

Return a boolean value after determining if a number has only odd digits. Numbers can't be converted to strings.

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

While loops

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

Check if each digit is odd by using a while loop. Check the last digit of the number and then update the number to remove the last digit, then check the final digit of the new number.

## All Digits Odd? Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise? 

No errors

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise? 

Used a while loop for checking digit status and for accepting a valid input.

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise? 

Learned how the while loop for accepting a correct input works

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.
