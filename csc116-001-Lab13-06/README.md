# CSC116: Lab 13 Journal - Input Files

Names: Nathan Holmes and Alexis Voulgaropoulos

## Process File (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

* What is already known about the problem?
* What questions do you have about the problem?

Have to scan in a file, make sure it exists and reprompt if it doesnt.
Need to compute the max, min, count, sum, and average of all integers in the file.
The average should be a double.
If there are no integers in the file, a message should be printed saying so.

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

The File object and using multiple scanners

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

If the file entered does not exist, reprompt.
Scan in only and all of the integers, compute the required calculations.
If no integer is found, print the message.

## Process File Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise? 

No errors

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise? 

Multiple scanner objects and the File object was used

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise? 

Learned about multiple scanner objects and that the console acts like a file to draw data from.

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.

40 minutes
