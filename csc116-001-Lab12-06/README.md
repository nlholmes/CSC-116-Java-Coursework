Names: Nathan Holmes and Alexis Voulgaropoulos

## Decimal to Binary Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

* What is already known about the problem?
* What questions do you have about the problem?

We need to get a valid input from the user and then return the base ten integer input as a binary string

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

do-while loops may be helpful here

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

While loops for valid inputs
Division and modulus to convert to binary

## Decimal to Binary Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise? 

No problems

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise? 

Used do-while loop

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise? 

Sometimes it can be tricky to use a do-while loop and an input variable as it seemed that sometimes it would not recognize the variable.
Also noticed that the input into java: 044 is valued at 36 when printed to the console. If however the user gives the input 044, it will be interpreted as 44.
